# HBN SFOS Cmake
Extra cmake modules used to build software for SailfishOS with CMake.

## Integrate into your Sailfish OS application
The easiest way is to simple download the latest release tarball. You can than copy the files you want to use into your source tree.

A better, and on the long run more comfortable solution, is to clone this repository and checkout the current stable branch/tag to work with. Or integrate it as a submodule into your project git tree.

### Cloning and branching
    git clone https://github.com/Huessenbergnetz/HBN_SFOS_Cmake.git

### Integrate into your project
You can copy the files or, the better way, include the configuration into your project.
